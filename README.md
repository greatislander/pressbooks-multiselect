# \<pressbooks-multiselect>

This webcomponent follows the [open-wc](https://github.com/open-wc/open-wc) recommendation.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @pressbooks/multiselect
```

## Usage

Wrap a `<select>` element with the `multiple` attribute and a semantically valid label in the
`<pressbooks-multiselect>` tag.

```html
<script type="module">
  import '@pressbooks/multiselect/pressbooks-multiselect.js';
</script>

<pressbooks-multiselect>
  <label for="selections">Multiple Selections</label>
  <select id="selections" name="selections[]">
    <option value="option-1">Option 1</option>
    <!-- Et cetera. -->
  </select>
</pressbooks-multiselect>
```

If you wrap a single select or a select element without a valid label, the component will not render and your existing
markup will be displayed without modification.

If the `<select>` element has a relationship with a hint via the `aria-describedby` attribute, the hint will be attached
to the rendered component as well.

### Styling

Because this web component uses the Shadow Dom, styling is limited to modification via CSS custom properties. However,
[there are plenty to choose from](https://github.com/greatislander/pressbooks-multiselect/blob/a87fab1f7b3ea967b3ae6b58400ed863084326ee/src/PressbooksMultiselect.js).
